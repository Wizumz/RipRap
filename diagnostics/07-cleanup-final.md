# Phase 7 - Post-Merge Cleanup Final Report

## Cleanup Operations Completed ✅

### Temporary Files Processed

#### ✅ Removed (One-off Debug Scripts)
- `test-crash-scenarios.js` - Manual crash scenario testing script
- `debug-monitor.js` - Browser-based error monitoring script

**Rationale**: These were one-off debugging tools not integrated into CI/test pipeline

#### ✅ Organized (Log Files)
- `firebase-debug.log` → `diagnostics/artifacts/firebase-debug.log`

**Rationale**: Preserved for historical debugging but moved to organized location

#### ✅ Preserved (Essential Infrastructure)
- **Test Framework**: All Playwright E2E tests and configuration
- **Emulator Config**: Firebase emulator setup for testing
- **Documentation**: All 7 phase reports in `diagnostics/`
- **Scripts**: All npm test scripts and CI/CD integration
