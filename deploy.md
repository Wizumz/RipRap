## Quick Deploy Steps

### Option 1: Drag & Drop Deploy (Fastest)

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder directly onto the deploy area
   - Your site will be live in seconds!

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended for ongoing updates)

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "ShoreLore rebrand complete"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
